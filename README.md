3. **Styling Elements**: Applies inline styles to each element for layout and presentation.


* What is the difference between `append()` and `appendChild()`?
Element.append() allows you to also append string objects, whereas Node.appendChild() only accepts Node objects. Element.append() has no return value, whereas Node.appendChild() returns the appended Node object. Element.append() can append several nodes and strings, whereas Node.appendChild() can only append one node.
